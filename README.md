# Car Balls

I am in the process of learning some Rust, along with the Bevy graphics engine
and the Rapier physics engine. My ultimate goal is to create some weird flying car game (cars flying in space). Maybe with O'Neill cylinders and other retro-futurist stuff. I'm an OpenTTD fan, so I wonder if I should also add some space trains. Ok you can see I have lots of ideas, and I'm not sure if I'll actually have time to code all of this. But as an interesting intermediate step, I have a car with some keyboard controls and I just added a bunch of balls. The result is quite fun! You can drive around and hit balls.


All of this runs in the browser thanks to webassembly.
